    "Summary statistics allow us to describe a vast, complex dataset using just a few key numbers. But there’s a danger in relying only on summary statistics and ignoring the overall distribution. Perhaps the most elegant demonstration of the dangers of summary statistics is Anscombe’s Quartet.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Anscombe's quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet appear very different when graphed. Each dataset consists of eleven (x,y) points. They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the importance of graphing data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties. He described the article as being intended to counter the impression among statisticians that \"numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough.\"\n",
